            <h2>pRb and Its Role in Mitosis</h2>
            <h3>What is pRb?</h3>
            <p>The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is a key protein that helps control cell division. It acts like a brake, stopping cells from dividing too quickly or when DNA is damaged, especially during the early stage of the cell cycle (G1 phase). pRb does this by blocking proteins called E2F, which trigger cell division. When the cell is ready to divide, other proteins turn off pRb, allowing division to proceed. pRb also helps ensure chromosomes are properly organized during cell division. If pRb is damaged, cells can divide uncontrollably, leading to errors in chromosome numbers and a higher risk of cancer (Manning & Dyson, 2013; National Cancer Institute, 2024).</p>

            <h3>How is pRb Made?</h3>
            <p>pRb is created through a clear process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gene to Blueprint</strong>: The RB1 gene, located on chromosome 13, is copied into a blueprint called mRNA inside the cell’s nucleus.</li>
                <li><strong>Building the Protein</strong>: The mRNA is used by the cell to build pRb, a protein made of 928 building blocks (amino acids).</li>
                <li><strong>Adjusting pRb</strong>: Special proteins add chemical tags (like phosphate groups) to pRb. These tags turn pRb on or off, controlling when it stops or allows cell division.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>pRb Problems and Cancer Risks</h3>
            <p>When the RB1 gene is damaged, pRb cannot do its job, leading to serious health problems, including cancer. Here are common issues with pRb:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small Gene Changes</strong>: Tiny errors in the RB1 gene can make pRb faulty, so it cannot stop cell division properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Missing Gene Parts</strong>: Large pieces of the RB1 gene can be lost, leaving no working pRb. This is common in eye and bone cancers.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Both Gene Copies</strong>: If both copies of the RB1 gene are damaged or lost, pRb stops working entirely, often seen in eye and lung cancers.</li>
                <li><strong>Gene Silencing</strong>: Chemical changes can “turn off” the RB1 gene, reducing pRb levels, which happens in breast and bladder cancers.</li>
                <li><strong>Overactive Control Proteins</strong>: Proteins that turn off pRb too often can mimic gene damage, causing cancers like skin or brain tumors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These problems can lead to cancers such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eye Cancer (Retinoblastoma)</strong>: Damaged pRb causes tumors in the eyes, often in young children.</li>
                <li><strong>Lung Cancer</strong>: pRb loss is found in most cases of a fast-growing lung cancer, making tumors aggressive.</li>
                <li><strong>Breast Cancer</strong>: Faulty pRb helps breast tumors grow and spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Bone Cancer (Osteosarcoma)</strong>: pRb damage increases bone tumor risk, especially in those with eye cancer history.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Cancers</strong>: pRb issues contribute to bladder, brain, and skin cancers by allowing cells with damaged DNA to keep dividing, which can also make treatments less effective.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without working pRb, cells divide too fast, chromosomes get mixed up, and DNA damage builds up, raising the risk of tumors and health problems (Manning & Dyson, 2013).</p>

                <p>pRb has a special part called the pocket domain that grabs onto E2F proteins to stop cell division. If this part is damaged, pRb cannot control cell growth properly (National Cancer Institute, 2024).</p>

            <h2>pRb Mutations and Cancer</h2>
            <p>Damage to the pRb gene stops it from controlling cell division. This leads to chromosome errors and unstable DNA, which can cause tumors to grow. Studies show that pRb problems allow cells with damaged DNA to keep dividing, driving cancer development (Manning & Dyson, 2013).</p>
